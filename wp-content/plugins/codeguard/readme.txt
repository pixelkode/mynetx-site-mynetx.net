CodeGuard protects your blog with daily automatic backup and monitoring. Automatically fix mistakes or problems with one click undo power.

== Description ==

CodeGuard is a secure, automatic daily backup service for your WordPress blog or website that notifies you when something changes and lets you undo it with ease.

In addition to taking automatic daily backups, CodeGuard does a comparison between each backup, which will reveal to you any new files that have been placed on your website or removed. Now you will know if your site has been hacked or altered.

CodeGuard will send you a ChangeAlert email any time that it finds your files have changed. This way, you can stay on top of everything that is happening to your website.

Should you ever need an old file, or if you overwrite a file, delete something, or just mess up your site - don't worry - CodeGuard has you covered with one-click undo power.

= Is it secure? =
The CodeGuard WordPress plugin uses strong cryptographic protocols, including RSA public key cryptography, to encrypt and protect your information in transit over the internet even if your web server is not configured with a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificate.

These security features protect the confidentiality of your data through both verification and encryption.

* Actively verifies that a backup request originated from an officially authorized CodeGuard.com server
* Encrypts all data using CodeGuard's 2048-bit RSA public key such that only officially authorized CodeGuard.com servers can read your data.
* Each WordPress plugin generates a unique RSA key pair for strong per-site security.
* Uses a RC4 stream cipher as implemented in the the OpenSSL library, which is the same library used to secure SSL websites hosted on the Apache Web Server.
